# Documentation

Here I'm going to put together docs and architecture description.

Right now this app should start in a PoC mode with a very limited set of feature to prove its usefulness. All other improvements will be validated and added to further releases.

Main requirements for the app: simplicity in development and use. Ease of deployment (as less components as possible). Secure and safe, so, the enemy won't get any insights from the app.

Tech stack:
- NextJS
- Okta
